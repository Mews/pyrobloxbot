# pyrobloxbot.decorators

```{admonition} Note
You don't need to apply these decorators to pyrobloxbot functions.
They are already applied to the functions that need them.

You should use them in case you're making your own custom methods and need them to exibit one of these behaviours.
```

```{eval-rst}
..  automodule:: pyrobloxbot.decorators
    :members:
