# pyrobloxbot

pyrobloxbot is an open-source package for making Roblox bots that interact with the game strictly through the keyboard.

It simplifies this process by providing features like:
- Methods for most actions your character can make, like movement, chatting, resetting, etc
- Methods to navigate through game ui elements through the keyboard only, to avoid needing the mouse which is unreliable
- Methods to join games, join users and join private servers
- Highly customizable bots, by changing different options to fit your use case
- A global failsafe to avoid your bot going rogue
